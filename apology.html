    <h1>I'm So Sorry</h1>
    <p>
      I don’t even know where to begin — maybe with how much I miss you.<br />
      You were such a huge part of my journey, from our estate days to Cairo,
      and I hate that I let distance and silence build a wall between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping out and coming home felt like everything was falling apart,
      and somewhere in the middle of my mess... I disappeared.
      But you didn’t deserve to be left out in the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know you're mad. You have every right to be. But I just want you to know:
      I still care deeply. I still remember your laughter, your kindness, and how
      much it meant to have you in my corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope this small note reaches you and softens the anger — even just a little.
      I hope it reminds you that you were never forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m sorry. I miss you. And I’d really love to reconnect.
    </p>
    <footer>— With love, always</footer>
